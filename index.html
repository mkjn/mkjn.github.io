<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>I am hosted with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> (using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>). (With an assist from <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>.)</p>

<h2>Current status</h2>

<p><b>Slowly</b> setting up this site, piece by piece. I like how Jekyl lets you manage content separately from other elements that make up the site.</p>

<hr />

<h3>What's left</h3>

<p>Almost everything.</p>

<h4>Next steps</h4>

<p>Where to start? I guess I need to finish putting the main building blocks in place, then I can work more on the design. And then, some test posts.</p>
