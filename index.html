<H1>Hello World</H1>

<P>I am hosted with GitHub Pages (using Jekyl). (With an assist from <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>.)</P>

<H2>Current status</H2>

<P><B>Slowly</B> setting up this site, piece by piece. I like how Jekyl lets you manage content separately from other elements that make up the site.</P>

<HR />

<H3>What's left</H3>

<P>Almost everything.</P>

<H4>Next steps</H4>

<P>Where to start? I guess I need to finish putting the main building blocks in place, then I can work more on the design. And then, some test posts.</P>
